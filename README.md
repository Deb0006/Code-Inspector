## Code Inspector

This is a Next.js project designed to provide an AI-powered explanation of code blocks. The project is bootstrapped with `create-next-app` and utilizes the OpenAI API, Prism.js for syntax highlighting, Firebase for user authentication, and content-filter-alpha API to protect from displaying any unsafe or sensitive text.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. You can edit the page by modifying `pages/index.js` and the page will auto-update. Additionally, API routes can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello).
